# Development Guide for Rust Search Engine

## What's Working

- Basic schema creation (text, u64 fields only)
- RAM and directory-based indices
- Simple document indexing (hardcoded field mapping)
- Basic IndexWriter operations (add_document, commit)
- Rudimentary search (AllQuery only, no query parsing)

## Field Types & Schema (Major Gap - 85% missing)

Current: Text, u64 only
Missing:

- i64, f64, bool, date, bytes, IP address, JSON object, facet fields
- Fast fields support (critical for performance)
- Field-specific indexing options (TEXT, STORED, INDEXED, FAST flags)
- Custom tokenizer assignment per field
- Field validation and proper schema introspection

## Query System (Major Gap - 95% missing)

Current: AllQuery only
Missing:

- Query parser (critical for real applications)
- Term queries, phrase queries, range queries
- Boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT combinations)
- Fuzzy queries, wildcard/regex queries
- More-like-this queries
- Phrase prefix queries
- Exists queries
- Custom scoring and boosting

## Document Operations (Major Gap - 70% missing)

Current: Basic add_document with hardcoded field mapping
Missing:

- Proper field-to-value mapping using schema
- Document updates and deletions
- Batch operations
- Document validation
- Proper JSON document handling
- Support for all field types in documents

## Search & Results (Major Gap - 90% missing)

Current: Basic add_document with hardcoded field mapping
Missing:

- Proper field-to-value mapping using schema
- Document updates and deletions
- Batch operations
- Document validation
- Proper JSON document handling
- Support for all field types in documents

## Tokenization (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Current: Uses default tokenizer only
Missing:

- Custom tokenizer registration
- Language-specific stemmers (en_stem, etc.)
- Token filters (lowercase, stop words, stemming)
- Regex tokenizers, N-gram tokenizers
- Pre-tokenized text support

## Aggregations (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Missing entire aggregation system:

- Bucket aggregations (histogram, date histogram, terms, range)
- Metric aggregations (avg, min, max, sum, count, stats, percentiles)
- Nested aggregations
- Elasticsearch-compatible JSON format

## Advanced Features (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Missing:

- Faceted search
- Index merging policies
- Distributed search support
- Index warming and caching
- Space usage analysis
- Custom collectors and scoring
- Index reader management and reload policies

## Error Handling & Performance (Gap - 60% missing)

Current: Basic error handling
Missing:

- Proper Elixir error types and messages
- Memory management and limits
- Background merging configuration
- Index optimization
- Resource cleanup and proper resource management

## Testing & Documentation (Gap - 80% missing)

Current: Basic tests for schema and indexing
Missing:

- Comprehensive test suite for all features
- Integration tests with real-world data
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Examples and usage guides
- Performance benchmarks
- Detailed error handling documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Changelog for version history
- Release notes for major changes
- Developer setup guide
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Code quality checks (formatting, linting)
- Dependency management and updates
- Versioning strategy (semantic versioning)
- Issue tracking and management
- Community engagement (forums, discussions)
- Contribution guidelines
- Code review process
- Pull request guidelines
