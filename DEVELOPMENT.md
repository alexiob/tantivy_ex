# Development Guide for Rust Search Engine

## What's Working

- Basic schema creation (text, u64 fields only)
- RAM and directory-based indices
- Simple document indexing (hardcoded field mapping)
- Basic IndexWriter operations (add_document, commit)
- Rudimentary search (AllQuery only, no query parsing)

## Field Types & Schema

Current:

- i64, f64, bool, date, bytes, IP address, JSON object, facet fields
- Fast fields support (critical for performance)
- Field-specific indexing options (TEXT, STORED, INDEXED, FAST flags)
- Custom tokenizer assignment per field
- Field validation and proper schema introspection

## Query System

Current:

- Query parser (critical for real applications)
- Term queries, phrase queries, range queries
- Boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT combinations)
- Fuzzy queries, wildcard/regex queries
- More-like-this queries
- Phrase prefix queries
- Exists queries
- Custom scoring and boosting

## Document Operations (✅ Complete)

Current implementation includes:

- ✅ Schema-aware field-to-value mapping with full validation
- ✅ Document updates and deletions with proper error handling
- ✅ Batch operations with configurable commit strategies
- ✅ Comprehensive document validation against schema
- ✅ Complete JSON document handling and preparation
- ✅ Support for all field types in documents (text, u64, i64, f64, bool, date, facet, bytes, json, ip_addr)
- ✅ Type conversion and validation functions
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms and detailed error reporting

## Search & Results ✅ Complete

Current: Comprehensive search functionality with advanced result processing

**Implemented Features:**

- ✅ Schema-aware field-to-value mapping using proper field types
- ✅ Full document search with TantivyEx.Searcher module
- ✅ Multiple search methods (search, search_ids, search_documents, search_with_parser)
- ✅ Support for both string queries and Query objects
- ✅ Advanced query types (Boolean, Term, Phrase, Range, Fuzzy, Wildcard, Regex, etc.)
- ✅ Query parser with Lucene-style syntax support
- ✅ Comprehensive result processing with TantivyEx.SearchResults module
- ✅ Schema-aware field type conversion and validation in results
- ✅ Advanced highlighting and snippet extraction
- ✅ Result pagination with metadata
- ✅ Performance analytics and metrics
- ✅ Result aggregation and faceting capabilities
- ✅ API response formatting with consistent structure
- ✅ Error handling and result validation

**Native Rust Implementation:**

- ✅ Full Tantivy query support including Boolean queries, Term queries, Phrase queries
- ✅ Enhanced search with document retrieval and scoring
- ✅ Proper field mapping and document conversion
- ✅ Performance-optimized search execution

## Tokenization (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Current: Uses default tokenizer only
Missing:

- Custom tokenizer registration
- Language-specific stemmers (en_stem, etc.)
- Token filters (lowercase, stop words, stemming)
- Regex tokenizers, N-gram tokenizers
- Pre-tokenized text support

## Aggregations (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Missing entire aggregation system:

- Bucket aggregations (histogram, date histogram, terms, range)
- Metric aggregations (avg, min, max, sum, count, stats, percentiles)
- Nested aggregations
- Elasticsearch-compatible JSON format

## Advanced Features (Major Gap - 100% missing)

Missing:

- Faceted search
- Index merging policies
- Distributed search support
- Index warming and caching
- Space usage analysis
- Custom collectors and scoring
- Index reader management and reload policies

## Error Handling & Performance (Gap - 60% missing)

Current: Basic error handling
Missing:

- Proper Elixir error types and messages
- Memory management and limits
- Background merging configuration
- Index optimization
- Resource cleanup and proper resource management

## Testing & Documentation (Gap - 80% missing)

Current: Basic tests for schema and indexing
Missing:

- Comprehensive test suite for all features
- Integration tests with real-world data
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Examples and usage guides
- Performance benchmarks
- Detailed error handling documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Changelog for version history
- Release notes for major changes
- Developer setup guide
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Code quality checks (formatting, linting)
- Dependency management and updates
- Versioning strategy (semantic versioning)
- Issue tracking and management
- Community engagement (forums, discussions)
- Contribution guidelines
- Code review process
- Pull request guidelines
